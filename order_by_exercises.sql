        --ORDER BY EXERCISE
-- Modify your first query to order by first name. The first result should be Irena Flexer and the last result should be Vidya Awdeh.
        SELECT first_name, last_name
        FROM employees
        WHERE first_name IN ('Irena', 'Vidya', 'Maya')
        ORDER BY first_name;



-- Update the query to order by first name and then last name. The first result should now be Irena Acton and the last should be Vidya Zweizig.



-- Change the ORDER BY clause so that you order by last name before first name. Your first result should still be Irena Acton but now the last result should be Maya Zyda.



-- Update your queries for employees with 'e' in their last name to sort the results by their employee number. Make sure the employee numbers are in the correct order.



-- Now reverse the sort order for both queries and compare results.
